# Friend Finder

## Friend Finder is a full stack app utilizing Heroku for deployment

### Friend finder is a friend compatibility-based application - aka a dating app. This full-stack site takes in results from multiple users' surveys and then compares their answers with those from other users. The app then displays the name and picture of the user that best matches the current users' answers.

## NPM Packages Used

This app is powered by three **NPM packages**.

**Express** is used to handle routing for the apiRoutes.js and htmlRoutes.js files. It is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
**Body-parser** is middleware which is software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications.
**Path** is built into Node.js. The path module provides utilities for working with file and directory paths.
